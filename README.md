# Lambda Calculus Interpreter using OCaml 
In this project I write an interpreter for Lambda Calculus using OCaml. I use dune to manage, build and execute my project. 

## Inspiration 
After reading An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculusa, a book by Greg Michaelson, I wanted to practice a bit of the knowledge that I learned.
